<h1>Privacy Policy – AJMI1 Calculator</h1>

<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2025</p>

<p>
The AJMI1 Calculator is a clinical decision-support application designed to assist healthcare professionals in evaluating cervical myelopathy severity using a structured scoring system. This Privacy Policy explains how the application handles data and protects user privacy.
</p>

<h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>
<p>
AJMI1 does <strong>not collect, store, process, transmit, or share</strong> any personal, medical, or device data. All calculations take place entirely on the user’s device.
</p>

<h2>2. No Internet Communication</h2>
<p>
The app operates fully offline. It does not communicate with any external servers, APIs, analytics services, or third-party systems.
</p>

<h2>3. No Use of Third-Party SDKs</h2>
<p>
AJMI1 does not use advertising networks, analytics SDKs, tracking technologies, or third-party service libraries that collect data.
</p>

<h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
<p>
AJMI1 does not store or retain any information entered by the user. All input remains in temporary memory and is cleared when the app is closed or reset.
</p>

<h2>5. No Healthcare Information Handling</h2>
<p>
Because AJMI1 does not store or transmit any information, it does not handle, process, or manage protected health information (PHI) under HIPAA or other regulatory frameworks.
</p>

<h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>
AJMI1 is intended for use by healthcare professionals and is not directed at children. The app does not collect any data from any users, including minors.
</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
If the functionality of the app changes in a way that affects data handling or privacy, this policy will be updated and made available through this same webpage.
</p>
